  <dt>Clarification</dt>
  <dd>this app built with the idea pf sharing it in the play store but since the unsplash API didn't allow me to upgrade to production because as they said I am replicating 
  the core of unplsah , so I decided to open source the code on github and stopping developing it.</dd>

## what have been done so far:

### 1- the sign up :
since we are going to use the app on user behalf so the app use oauth 2.0 flow in the authentication process with the unpslah API , and more than that the app is 
backed by user password authentication (the password should be strong the be acceptable.
